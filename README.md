# NeIC 2017 conference page mockup

### Design decisions

- Jekyll to leverage GitHub pages
- GitHub to simplify contributions
- Separation of content (Markdown and YAML), templating (HTML and Liquid), and styling (CSS Bootstrap)
- Programmed for future reuse
- Schedule table is autogenerated from Markdown and YAML data

### How to serve this page locally

```
$ jekyll serve
```
